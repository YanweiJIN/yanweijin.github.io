I am a **full-time research assistant** at the  [Hong Kong Centre for Cerebro-Cardiovascular Health Engineering](https://www.hkcoche.org), my supervisor is [Prof. Yuanting ZHANG](https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/persons/yuanting-zhang(fcbe72e3-c0b5-4217-b177-653f710f4bed).html) and my work primarily involves: 
  1. **Bio-signal Preprocessing**: My responsibilities include the preprocessing of bio-signals such as ECG, PPG, Blood Pressure, and other relevant data. 
  2. **Feature Extraction**: I assist in the extraction of meaningful features from complex datasets, which is an essential step in biomedical data analysis. 
  3. **Machine Learning Model Development**: My role includes supporting the development of machine learning models for estimating vital health parameters, including blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and epilepsy prediction. 
  4. **Knowledge Graph Construction**: I contribute to the construction of knowledge graphs for disease classification, with a specific focus on Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs). 

I graduated from **Peking University** in the summer of 2022 with a **Bachelor of Science degree in Nursing**. My educational background has provided me with a strong foundation in health science. However, what truly excites me is the intersection of health science and data science. I possess solid mathematical and coding skills, allowing me to seamlessly blend these two fields.

My research interests primarily focus on the **application of machine learning in health science**, particularly in the realm of **daily health monitoring and alert** systems. I am passionate about leveraging my expertise to develop practical solutions for daily **wearable devices** that can enhance and improve people's health and well-being.
