I am a **full-time research assistant** at the  [Hong Kong Centre for Cerebro-Cardiovascular Health Engineering](https://www.hkcoche.org), my supervisor is [Prof. Yuanting ZHANG](https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/persons/yuanting-zhang(fcbe72e3-c0b5-4217-b177-653f710f4bed).html) and my work primarily involves: 
  1. **Bio-signal Preprocessing**: My responsibilities include the preprocessing of bio-signals such as ECG, PPG, Blood Pressure, and other relevant data. 
  2. **Feature Extraction**: I assist in the extraction of meaningful features from complex datasets, which is an essential step in biomedical data analysis. 
  3. **Machine Learning Model Development**: My role includes supporting the development of machine learning models for estimating vital health parameters, including blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and epilepsy prediction. 
  4. **Knowledge Graph Construction**: I contribute to the construction of knowledge graphs for disease classification, with a specific focus on Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs). 


I hold a **Bachelor of Science in Nursing** from **Peking University**. During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to participate in research projects, and I served as **the first author** of a published paper, which delved into a critical aspect of **COVID-19** and garnered recognition from **the World Health Organization (WHO)**. Additionally, my third paper, centered on **Blood Pressure Estimation**, was successfully published during my tenure at HK COCHE. 


I am a **self-motivated** individual with a **strong passion for research**. I am willing to commit significant time to my work, dedicating up to 12 hours a day to deepen my understanding of the knowledge necessary for my job. My ultimate aspiration is to **contribute significantly to human health and scientific advancement**, with the goal of becoming a respected figure in the world of science.
