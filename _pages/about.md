I'm a Research Assistant working at [Hong Kong Centre for Cerebro-Cardiovascular Health Engineering](https://www.hkcoche.org). My supervisor is [Prof. Yuanting ZHANG](https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/persons/yuanting-zhang(fcbe72e3-c0b5-4217-b177-653f710f4bed).html). My current work focuses on the construction of cuffless dynamic blood pressure prediction models using machine learning methods.
