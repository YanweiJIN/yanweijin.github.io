I am a first-year master's student in the Biostatistics and Health Data Science Division at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. I have a strong passion for statistics and coding, as well as a deep interest in reading and research. My primary focus lies in wearable devices and machine learning methods. I am actively seeking research opportunities in these areas and would greatly appreciate any chance to contribute to related projects.
