In this project, we utilized the MIMIC-IV dataset to develop a machine learning model for cardiovascular disease (CVD) classification. My responsibilities encompassed:
* Identifying cardiovascular disease (CVD) subjects based on ICD codes.
* Exploring the construction of a knowledge graph to identify potential associations with the CVDs' occupation.
