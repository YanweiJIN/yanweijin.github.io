This research project was conducted as part of the **National College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Practice** in China. It centered on the creation of a **home care guide for elderly individuals with dementia**. My responsibilities within this project included:
* Conducting a comprehensive **review** of dementia home care research on scholarly platforms, **evaluating literature quality** with input from three experts, and extracting essential content.
* **Crafting the guidance document** based on the findings from my review and valuable insights from clinical experts and professors.
* Utilizing AutoCAD software to **produce 2D and 3D illustrations** for [the guide](https://yanweijin.github.io/files/Dementia_guidance.pdf).
