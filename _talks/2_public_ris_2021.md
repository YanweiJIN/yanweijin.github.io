This research project, supported by the **Beijing Natural Science Foundation Committee**, involved a **qualitative study** concentrating on the public's preventive actions and responses to major public health emergencies. We conducted in-depth interviews across China and meticulously analyzed the gathered data to enhance our research. My contributions to this study encompassed two primary areas:
1. Public Reaction to COVID-19:
   * Conducted a comprehensive search for COVID-19-related literature regarding public risk perception and coping behaviors, utilizing databases such as PubMed. Conducted quality assessments and extracted relevant content.
   * Employed Stata to perform **meta-analysis, subgroup analysis, and meta-regression**, summarizing the findings and identifying sources of heterogeneity within the included literature.
   * Executed **sensitivity analyses** and Egger's tests to ensure the robustness of our research outcomes.
   * Consolidated the above findings and **authored a paper as the first author**. This paper received citations from the World Health Organization (WHO).
2. Healthcare Providers' Responses during Public Health Emergencies:
   * Developed an interview protocol for interactions with healthcare providers and conducted interviews in Beijing to collect research materials.
   * Applied **Colaizzi's 7-step analysis method** and utilized **NVIVO** for key information extraction.
   * Formulated a time-based **risk perception model**.
   * Contributed to the paper's development process.
