This is part of Ms. Huang Ke's PhD program at City University of Hong Kong, where we are focused on using EEG and other multi-modal signals from open-access datasets to predict epileptic seizures using machine learning models. My contributions to this project include the following tasks:
1. **Dataset Selection:** I conducted extensive research to identify suitable open-access datasets and made selections based on EEG channels.
2. **Feature Extraction:** I utilized [EEGLab](https://yanweijin.github.io/images/eeglab.jpg) and the [Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)](https://yanweijin.github.io/images/DWT.png) to extract relevant features from the EEG data.
3. **Deep Learning-Based Feature Extraction:** I explored [deep learning techniques](https://yanweijin.github.io/images/DWT.png) for feature extraction from the multi-modal signals.
