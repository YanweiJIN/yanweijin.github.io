This is part of Ms. XIANG Ting's PhD program at City University, where we employ a variety of physiological signals, including PPG, ECG, IPG, and temperature, to estimate blood pressure using both machine learning and mathematical models. The data for all subjects was obtained from COCHE Lab, and my contributions to this project encompass the following tasks:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: I handled the preprocessing of the multi-modal data, ensuring its suitability for analysis.

2. **Feature Extraction and Normalization**: I extracted relevant features from the data and normalized them for consistency.

7. Research Paper: I participated in the development of our first research paper, which involved comparisons with mathematical models.
8. Second Paper Preparation: Currently, I'm working on incorporating additional data into our models and preparing a second research paper.
