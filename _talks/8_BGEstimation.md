This project is part of the HKSTP Ideation program, and our primary goal is to enhance the accuracy of non-invasive daily blood glucose estimation methods. My specific contributions to this project involve:
1. **Clinical Protocol Development:** I've created a comprehensive [Clinical Protocol](https://yanweijin.github.io/files/bg_protocol.pdf) to guide our research and experiments.
2. **Rapid Blood Glucose Monitoring:** We've been utilizing the Contour Plus Elite system for swift blood glucose monitoring, making the process efficient and effective. You can see an example of a blood glucose test in the image below:
