**Abstract**： This study aims to investigate the effects of cold pressor test (CPT) on heart rate (HR) and HR variability (HRV), which are clinically useful parameters for the assessment of autonomic nerve function and cardiovascular activities. The CPTs were conducted on 22 subjects under 4 different phases including: baseline phase (Rest1), cold stimulus phase, recovery phase and followed by another baseline phase (Rest2). It was found in this study that exposure to the cold water would result in significant increased HR (p<0.001) and decreased HRV, reflecting the regulation process of the autonomic balance to adapt to the temperature change. Notably, a unique response was observed in one hypertensive subject that his HR decreased during cold stimulus phase. The results of this study should be helpful for understanding the regulatory mechanisms of the autonomic system and its effects on the cardiovascular system and thus, provide a possible approach for the intervention and management of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).
